<p>C.    The scope and term of your license depends on the type of license you<br>are provided by Intel.  The variety of license types are set forth below, which<br>may not be available for all “Intel(R) Software Development Products” and<br>therefore may not apply to the Materials.  For more information on the types of<br>licenses, please contact Intel or your sales representative.</p>
<p>i.    PRE-RELEASE LICENSE:  If you are using the Materials under the control<br>of a pre-release license, (a) the Materials are deemed to be pre-release code<br>(e.g., alpha or beta release, etc), which may not be fully functional and which<br>Intel may substantially modify in development of a  commercial version, and for<br>which Intel makes no assurances that it will ever develop or make generally<br>available a commercial version, and (b) if you are an individual, you have the<br>right to use the Materials only for the duration of the pre-release term, which<br>is specified in the Materials, or until the commercial release, if any, of the<br>Materials, whichever is shorter.  You may install copies of the Materials on an<br>unlimited number of computers provided that you are the only individual using<br>the Materials and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one time.<br>A separate license is required for each additional use and/or individual user<br>in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer<br>systems, and other use methods known now and in the future.

A separate<br>license is required for each additional use and/or individual user in all other<br>cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer systems, and other<br>use methods known now and in the future.  Intel may provide you with a license<br>code key that enables the Materials for an evaluation license.  If you are an<br>entity, Intel grants you the right to designate one individual within your<br>organization to have the sole right to use the Materials in the manner<br>provided above.</p>
<p>iii.    NONCOMMERCIAL-USE LICENSE:  If you are using the Materials under the<br>control of a noncommercial-use license, if you are an individual, you as an<br>individual may use the Materials only for non-commercial use where you receive<br>no fee, salary or any other form of compensation.  The Materials may not be used<br>for any other purpose, whether “for profit” or “not for profit.”  Any work<br>performed or produced as a result of use of the Materials cannot be performed<br>or produced for the benefit of other parties for a fee, compensation or any<br>other<br>reimbursement or remuneration.  You may install copies of the Materials on an<br>unlimited number of computers provided that you are the only individual using<br>the Materials and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one time.<br>A separate license is required for each additional use and/or individual user<br>in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer<br>systems, and other methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel will<br>provide you with a license code key that enables the Materials for a<br>noncommercial-use license.  If you obtained a time-limited noncommercial-use<br>license, the duration (time period) of your license and your ability to use the<br>Materials is limited to the time period of the obtained license, which is<br>controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  If you are an entity,<br>Intel grants you the right to designate one individual within your organization<br>to have the sole right to use the Materials in the manner provided above.</p>
<p>iv.    SINGLE-USER LICENSE: If you are using the Materials under the control<br>of a single-user license, you as an individual may install and use the Materials<br>on an unlimited number of computers provided that you are the only individual<br>using the Materials and only one copy of the Materials is in use at any one<br>time.  A separate license is required for each additional use and/or individual<br>user in all other cases, including without limitation, use by persons, computer<br>systems, and other methods of use known now and in the future.

Intel<br>will provide you with a license code key that enables the Materials for a Node-<br>Locked license up to the authorized number of concurrent users.  If you obtained<br>a time-limited node-locked license, the term of your license and your ability to<br>use the Materials is limited to the specified time, which is controlled by the<br>license key code for the Materials.</p>
<p>vi.    FLOATING LICENSE: If you are using the Materials under the control of a<br>floating license, you may (a) install the Materials on an unlimited number of<br>computers that are connected to the designated network and (b) use the Material<br>by no more than the authorized number of concurrent individual users.<br>A separate license is required for each additional concurrent individual user<br>and each additional use by a computer system and/or network on which the<br>Materials are used. You understand that you must obtain a  separate license for<br>every and any use of the Materials under a floating license, regardless of<br>whether such use is, without limitation, by persons, computer systems, and other<br>methods of use known now and in the future.  Intel will provide you with a<br>license code key that enables the Materials for a floating license up to the<br>authorized number of concurrent users.  If you obtained a time-limited Floating<br>license, the duration (time period) of your license and your ability to use the<br>Materials is limited to the time period of the obtained license, which is<br>controlled by the license key code for the Materials.  Intel Library Floating<br>License: If the Materials are the Intel(R) Math Kernel Library or the Intel(R)<br>Integrated Performance Primitives Library or the Intel(R) Threading Building<br>Blocks (either “Intel Library”), then the Intel Library is provided to you as an<br>add-on option to either the Intel(R) C++ Compiler product or the Intel(R)<br>Fortran Compiler product (either, an “Intel Compiler”) for which you have a<br>Floating license, and as such, in addition to the terms and conditions above,<br>the Intel Library may only be used by the authorized concurrent users (as noted<br>above) of that Intel Compiler Floating license.</p>
<p>D.    DISTRIBUTION:  Distribution of the Redistributables is also subject to<br>the following limitations:  You (i) shall be solely responsible to your<br>customers for any update or support obligation or other liability which may<br>arise from the distribution, (ii) shall not make any statement that your product<br>is “certified”, or that its performance is guaranteed, by Intel, (iii) shall not<br>use Intel’s name or trademarks to market your product without written<br>permission, (iv) shall use a license agreement that prohibits disassembly and<br>reverse engineering of the Redistributables, (v) shall indemnify, hold harmless,<br>and defend Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits,<br>including attorney’s fees, that arise or result from your distribution of<br>any product.</p>

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if you<br>implement the Sample Sources in your application or if you use Intel IPP to<br>implement algorithms that are protected by others’ licenses then you may need<br>additional licenses from various entities. Should any such additional licenses<br>be required, you are solely responsible for obtaining any such licenses and<br>agree to obtain any such licenses at your own expense.</p>
<p>ii.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a valid license to<br>Intel IPP is a prerequisite to any license for Sample Source, and possession of<br>Sample Source does not grant any license to Intel IPP (or any portion thereof).<br>To access Sample Source, you must first register your licensed copy of the Intel<br>IPP with Intel.  By downloading, installing or copying any Sample Source file,<br>you agree to be bound by terms of this Agreement.</p>
